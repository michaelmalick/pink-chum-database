===========

1. Kotzebue chum salmon ages were corrected to be ages 3-7, not ages 2-6. This
   change does not impact the total recruitment values.

2. For Fraser River chum salmon, the 1966 brood year was flagged as don't use
   because of a suspect spawner value.

3. Age structure for Prince Williamson Sound chum salmon was changed from a mix
   of data and average age proportions to assuming all returns were age-4. The
   age-proportions previously used are suspect and alternative values were not
   available.

4. Age structure for Upper Cook Inlet chum salmon was changed from a mix of data
   and average age proportions to assuming all returns were age-4. The
   age-proportions previously used are suspect and alternative values were not
   available.
